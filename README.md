# Project Manager
I started this project as a pretext for deepening of technologies and tools: Typescript , Angular7, Express NodeJS, Webpack, PrimeNg.
<br>Objectives:
 - using typescript not only on client side, but server side too 
 - having a shared folder for models and other useful code on both sides: client and server
 - use automatic nodejs server update with nodemon and webpack
 - use angular live dev server with proxy
 - create base classes for Server side: Controller, Service, Repository
 - create base classes for Client side: entity typed generic service 
 - create generic layout for applications with left side slide tree menu
 - create components to generate list for desktop and mobile devices, edit entity form
